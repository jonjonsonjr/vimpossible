vimpossible
===========

This is a very basic game that I created to help me with my proficiency in vim.
I always reach for the arrow keys instead of h,j,k,l, so this game forces you 
to use those keys to dodge enemies.

Use h, j, k, l to move left, down, up, right

Why [HJKL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HJKL_keys#HJKL_keys)? See the keyboard layout of the [ADM-38](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A)
